					<h4>Blake Ratcliff, Founder, CEO</h4>

					<p>Blake brings the key experience to this opportunity.  The key will be the establishment and expansion of the B2B sales program.  Over the past 6 years, Blake has developed several key opportunities from concept to several million dollars.  For IBTS, Blake created the disaster recovery program from an initial $300K temporary project to $7 million in annual revenue.  Today, this program is $20 million in annual revenues.

At US Inspect, Blake turned around the residential program from losing 10% production annually by increasing field capacity over 50% and growing the business $2 million annually in 24 months.  Also, at US Inspect, Blake established the federal foreclosure inspection program first winning the program and then eliminating the single competitor and growing it to a ramp approaching $1 million annually in less than 24 months.  Each of these opportunities shares a few common threads that are critical to the VTM opportunity including: 1) all were B2B sales, 2) all but one required launching sales, creating a pipeline and then closing a continuing string of sales, 3) they share common client prospects except for the consumer services area.
