			<p class="mgb-15em">Blake brings the key experience to this opportunity. The key will be the establishment and expansion of the B2B sales program. Over the past 6 years, Blake has developed several key opportunities from concept to several million dollars. For IBTS, Blake created the disaster recovery program from an initial $300K temporary project to $7 million in annual revenue. Today, this program is $20 million in annual revenues. Also, for IBTS, Blake created the solar QA program reaching the first $1 million in 2012. This program is now over $4 million. At US Inspect, Blake turned around the residential program from losing 10% production annually by increasing field capacity over 50% and growing the business $2 million annually in 24 months. Also, at US Inspect, Blake established the federal foreclosure inspection program first winning the program and then eliminating the single competitor and growing it to a ramp approaching $1 million annually in less than 24 months. Each of these opportunities shares a few common threads that are critical to the VTM opportunity including: 1) all were B2B sales, 2) all but one required launching sales, creating a pipeline and then closing a continuing string of sales, 3) they share common client prospects except for the consumer services area. Together, they provide a strong base to expect a repeat performance for VTM.</p>
